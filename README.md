# Custom-Manual
I always find the manuals for most commands to be extremely unhelpful, unless if you already understand the snytax in and out. This manual helps me recall certain
commands and gives ideas about alternate ways to format data, or perform whatever task needed for the script. I plan on adding more commands as I learn, but also
creating categories to better locate commands when trying to implement certain tasks. Ex. Need to delete lines of text? examples in GREP/AWK/TR/SED as follows.
